        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hi, my name is Lori Cabrie, and I am 20 years old. I’ve grown up in Charlotte all my life with my family.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’ve only worked basic retail jobs so far, so I haven’t very much professional experience. However, I’ve begun applying for internships this year and am hoping to gain some experience through those.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from Walnut Grove Christian School, where I served as salutatorian. I am currently a junior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a concentration in Software Engineering.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I haven’t taken any courses that use HTML, so this will be the first time I learn the language and build a website. I’m excited to use my Computer Science skills in a creative outlet.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Dell laptop, Windows</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm taking and why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MATH1242 - Calculus II:</strong> It’s a requirement for Software Engineering, but I also have a minor in mathematics, so it’s for that too.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS3160 - Database Design and Implementation:</strong> It’s a requirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC3146 - Operating Systems and Networking:</strong> It’s a requirement but I honestly really enjoyed Computer Systems which worked with C, so I probably would’ve wanted to take it for C++ anyways.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITCS4114 - Real World Algorithms:</strong> I wasn’t able to take Software Engineering this semester due to some complications, so I decided to take this instead.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting thing about me:</strong>I’m an identical twin. Contrary to popular belief we have polar opposite personalities. We are basically each other’s other half.
            </li>
        </ul>
