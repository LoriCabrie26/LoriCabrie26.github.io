            <p>I started playing video-games when I was around 16 years old, so it's been about 4 years now.</p>
            <p>I've never enjoyed a hobby more. Even with my disability, I was still able to find games that I could play and enjoy, pvp included. 
            Though it took me a while to learn, that is part of the fun! There is nothing like watching yourself improve and gain confidence in a new game. 
            It makes all of the early losses and mistakes more than worth it.</p>

            <p>This really just depends on your personal schedule. Play at the times that work best for you!</p>
            <p>Personally, I prefer to play towards the end of the day or at night. I like having nothing left to worry about when I play, let's me focus more on the game.</p>

            <p>Everyone is different but most people enjoy playing at a desk (Including me). Above is the basic layout of my own set up. As you can see, I have both a Nintendo Switch and a PlayStation 5. This brings us to the topic of platforms!</p>
            <p>There are quite a few different platforms that you can play video-games on. Most of them fall into four main categories currently.</p>
            <p>These categories are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>PlayStation</li>
                <li>Xbox</li>
                <li>Nintendo</li>
                <li>PC</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will say, if you don't own any of these platforms, they can be expensive to purchase depending on what you buy. 
            My suggestion is to just pick the one that works best for your budget! For example, I like Playstation the best and had a PlayStation 4 before I got my 5.</p>

            <p>Starting to play video-games is a pretty simple process.
            </p>
            <p>Here's a list of steps that I think help:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Pick and buy your platform</li>
                <li>2. Get any preferred accessories (headphones, microphones, controllers, etc.)</li>
                <li>3. Set up your space</li>
                <li>4. Pick and purchase your game</li>
                <li>5. Start playing and have fun!</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="collapsible" id="why">
            <!--Why should I play video-games?-->
            <h2 class="collapsible-header">Why should you play video-games?</h2>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/image7.jpeg" alt="Spider-man ps5">
                    <figcaption>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Personally, I love playing video-games because it gives me an escape from everyday life. Also it has helped me work through things analitically and fed my creativity.</p>
                <p>For somebody who always struggled with sports when I was younger, video-gaming also helped me tap into my competitive side, without feeling left out.</p>
                <p>I'm also a huge nerd, so being able to play games centered around stuff I already enjoyed was super fun for me.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>But aside from my personal perspective, video-gaming is a great way to make friends and connect with others. If you like art, so many games have some the most beautiful art I have ever seen!</p>
                <p>Like I said earlier video-gaming can be for everyone because there are just so many games out there, you just have to find what works best for you! :)</p>
