                                I plan to also add a header and footer. Her name will be at the center and I might make it where if you click on her name you will go to the introduction page
                                (There will still be a hyperlink to it in the header). Anything else she requests will be added as well.</li>

                                I plan to also add a header and footer. I'm thinking of doing a slide in feature for the text and/or professional image. One that moves smoothly.</li>

                                I plan to also add a header and footer. I'm thinking of doing a slide in feature for the text and/or images, same as the introduction page. I might decide to do drop-downs 
                            instead but will see which one my client likes more.</li>

                                I plan to also add a header and footer. Based on the design options I've talked about with my client, there will be extra features
                                added to this page based on the videos and photos put in. These will be finalized when we finalize which videos and pictures she would
                                like to use.

                            <li>This page will have buttons, hyperlinks, videos and images. When any hyperlink is clicked it will go to its respective page.
                                I plan to also add a header and footer. A resume link/button will be added to this page. Similar to how the reels will be added, self-tape videos for recruiters will also be included. 
                                Full layout isn't quite finalized for this page yet, but it will be a little similar to the contact page.

                <h2>Dynamic Functionality</h2>
                <p> For Dynamic Functionality features, I really want to add small photo galleries on both the experience page and the contact page.
                    The experience page photo gallery will have photos of her working/performing, while the contact page photo gallery will have some photos from her instagram posts.
                    I might added a few interactive images as well, but I need to work on that with my client.
